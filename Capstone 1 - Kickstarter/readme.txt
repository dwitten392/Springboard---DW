This project takes data from Kickstart.com to figure out if we can predict what projects will be successful and what is most important to project success.

In this folder, you will find two versions of the code. The Modeling with Engineering version has analysis performed but not used in the final report while the clean version has this code removed. You will also find the final report (PDF) and slides (pptx) for this project.

I later came back to improve on this project using ChatGPT.
