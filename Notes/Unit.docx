Exploratory Data Analysis and Visualization
-	Always have an initial question before going into the data
o	This can change, but ask a scientist you need to go in with a hypothesis
-	The initial example was the antibiotic table
o	Which antibiotics are most effective against different bacteria? (gram negative vs. gram positive)
o	Which antibiotics should be combined?
-	Visualize that data and come up with more questions before apply any statistics
o	Explain and explore
-	Can use seaborn for visualization in Python
o	Go to Seaborn website for tutorial
-	Only hard rule: bar charts start at zero
o	If you change axis from zero-base
-	Chart Suggestions – A Thought Starter
-	Histograms: Always play with the bin size
-	Create a lot of visualizations quickly for one thing without attachment, so you can figure out what works and what doesn’t
-	Don’t use color intensity or colors to show quantitative differences, could show cardinal differences or categorical
o	Position and length are better for quantitative differences
-	Color brewer in seaborn to get a color scale (easy to read, not offensive, no color blindness issues)

Storytelling and Effective Communication
-	Essential Question
o	What is the goal (of communication in DS)?
o	Who cares (and why should they care)?
-	IMAC
o	Inferential goal
o	Model
o	Algorithms
o	Conclusions and checking
-	Know your audience, tell a story, be careful with notation, be a great writer, have a sense of direction (sign-posting, following a path)
-	It is good if your story (about data) brings about new questions
-	Use visuals
-	The presentation should be an advertisement for your paper
-	What do people know beforehand? Did they have biases?
-	Framing – Why should I care?
o	Everyone has an opinion and a point of view (share your own)
	Still, keep your audience in mind
o	Engage people’s emotions (but keep your integrity)
